The main goal is to provide a mobile implementation for an application we love to use on our desktop, Money Manager EX.

Compatible with MMEX4Desktop 1.9 or upper.

Permission: read SMS for new feature for SMS
We remove SMS automation

Long Description
Money Manager Ex is a free, Open Source, cross-platform, easy-to-use personal finance software. It primarily helps organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when and how the money flows. It is a great tool to get a bird's eye view of your financial worth.

Money Manager Ex includes all the basic features that most users would want to see in a personal finance application. The design goals are focus on simplicity and user-friendliness - something one can use everyday.

Financial management can be complicated if there is no clear understanding of how much money we are receiving or spending. The first step towards financial stability is to maintain good financial records: it's only when we have a clear understanding of where our money goes, that we can make an informed decision of where to cut back on expenses. There is no right or wrong answer to spending money but personal finance software will help you analyze the financial data and give a better insight into what is going on. If you have started thinking of using Personal finance software, you are well on your way to making every dollar count.

☆ ACCOUNTS AND CURRENCIES Wizard to simplify creation of accounts and start using MMEX for Android. You have the flexibility of creating accounts in any of the multiple currencies available.

☆ TRANSACTIONS Overview of all income and expenses: separate and highlight records with different statuses. Search, filter, and sort by any field to have a clear view of your accounts at any time.

☆ PAYEES AND CATEGORIES Categories indicate the reason an expenditure is made or an income is received. Payees are the people or the institutions that give money or who are paid for goods and services.

☆ RECURRING TRANSACTIONS Special transactions set up in order to have the transaction entered into the database at some future date. They generally occur at regular intervals based on a schedule.

☆ BUDGETING Set up a budget for a year and/or a month. Then compare money spent versus actual budget with specific or custom reports. On Android we currently support a read-only view of the Budgets.

☆ CROSS PLATFORM We provide builds for the most common operating systems: Windows, MacOS and Linux Ubuntu. It's possible to use it also on other OS building it directly from source code.

☆ CLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION With cloud synchronization you can keep your expenses and income up-to-date on your PCs, notebooks, and all of your Android devices. Using common cloud storage providers, you can share your data with other family members.

You can download the map data for a specific area and edit the map. After editing, you can upload it directly to the OSM servers.

Any accidental change can be undone and all changes are listed for review before upload. Tag-autocompletion, JOSM compatible presets, links to the translated map-features pages and even auto-completing nearby street names help to find the right tags to use.

We recommend disabling auto-updates for Vespucci so that you can upload your edits before app updates.

More information and documentation can be found on vespucci.io and in the on-device help.

Please do not report problems here or ask for support, see why we can't provide support and accept issues on the play store review section. You can  report issues  directly from the app without a github account or go directly to the issue tracker.

Follow anyone across the fediverse and see it all in chronological order. No algorithms, ads, or clickbait in sight.

This is the official Android app for Mastodon. It is blazing fast and stunningly beautiful, designed to be not just powerful but also easy to use. In our app, you can:

EXPLORE

■ Discover new writers, journalists, artists, photographers, scientists and more
■ See what’s happening in the world

READ

■ Keep up with people you care about in a chronological feed with no interruptions
■ Follow hashtags to keep up with specific topics in real time

CREATE

■ Post to your followers or the whole world, with polls, high quality images and videos
■ Participate in interesting conversations with other people

CURATE

■ Create lists of people to never miss a post
■ Filter words or phrases to control what you do and don’t want to see

AND MORE!

■ A beautiful theme that adapts to your personalized color scheme, light or dark
■ Share and scan QR codes to quickly exchange Mastodon profiles with others
■ Login and switch between multiple accounts
■ Get notified when a specific person posts with the bell button
■ No spoilers! You can put your posts behind content warnings

A POWERFUL PUBLISHING PLATFORM

You no longer have to try and appease an opaque algorithm that decides if your friends are going to see what you posted. If they follow you, they’ll see it.

If you publish it to the open web, it’s accessible on the open web. You can safely share links to Mastodon in the knowledge that anyone will be able to read them without logging in.

Between threads, polls, high quality images, videos, audio, and content warnings, Mastodon offers plenty of ways to express yourself in a way that suits you.

A POWERFUL READING PLATFORM

We don’t need to show you ads, so we don’t need to keep you in our app. Mastodon has the richest selection of 3rd party apps and integrations so you can choose the experience that fits you best.

Thanks to the chronological home feed, it’s easy to tell when you’ve caught up on all updates and can move on to something else.

No need to worry that a misclick will ruin your recommendations forever. We don’t guess what you want to see, we let you control it.

PROTOCOLS, NOT PLATFORMS

Mastodon is not like a traditional social media platform, but is built on a decentralized protocol. You can sign up on our official server, or choose a 3rd party to host your data and moderate your experience.

Thanks to the common protocol, no matter what you choose, you can communicate seamlessly with people on other Mastodon servers. But there’s more: With just one account, you can communicate with people from other fediverse platforms.

Not happy with your choice? You can always switch to a different Mastodon server while taking your followers with you. For advanced users, you can even host your data on your own infrastructure, since Mastodon is open-source.

NON-PROFIT IN NATURE

Mastodon is a registered non-profit in the US and Germany. We are not motivated by extracting monetary value from the platform, but by what’s best for the platform.

AS FEATURED IN: TIME, Forbes, Wired, The Guardian, CNN, The Verge, TechCrunch, Financial Times, Gizmodo, PCMAG.com, and more."

You can automate time tracking using geo-fencing functions (see below). You may also categorize each recorded interval by a predefined client/task and a free text. Of course, the list of clients/tasks can be edited to suit your needs, and the app has a widget for your home screen.

Additionally, if you wish, your flexible time account is taken care of: you always see how much you worked. You can also keep an eye on how much work time is left for today or for the current week (by a notification
which you can enable).

The app enables you to modify the planned working time effortlessly - just tap on the date you want to edit in the main table.

You may provide the geo-coordinates of your work place and the app can automatically clock you in while you are at work. This is done without using GPS, so your battery won't be emptied by this app.

You also may provide a Wi-Fi network name which is visible at your work place the app can use to clock in automatically when this SSID is in range (you don't need to be connected to this network). Of course you should have Wi-Fi enabled for this to work.

You don't want to open the app for clocking in and out? No problem - there are at least three ways to do that: add the widget to your home screen, use launcher shortcuts (long press the app icon for that) or add a new quick settings tile to your panel by tapping on the pencil below and dragging the ""Track Work Time"" tile up which then can toggle your clocked-in state.

If you prefer to use other apps like Llama or Tasker for tracking your movements, that's fine - TWT can be triggered from other apps and just do the book-keeping of your work time. In this case, you have to create broadcast intents called org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockIn or org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockOut. When using ClockIn, you can also set the parameters task=... and text=... in the ""extra"" section of the intent so your events are more meaningful. You can also use the action org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.StatusRequest to get the current state of TWT: is the user clocked in, and if so, with which task and how much time remains for today? For more details on this, see the web site.

If you have a Pebble smart watch, the app will notify you on clock-in and clock-out events which is especially useful if you want to be in the know about automatic time tracking via location and/or WiFi.

Finally, the app can generate reports for you. The raw events report is the right thing if you want to import your data somewhere else, while year/month/week reports are fine if you want to keep track of your task progress.

Important note: This app definitely won't use your personal data for anything you don't want! It uses the INTERNET permission only to offer you to send some information about crashes to the developer (and does that only if you agree, you will be asked every time). The app does NOT include tracked times or places in the bug report, but the general log file is appended and might potentially include personal data - if so, it will be kept strictly confidential and only used to identify the problem.

This is an open source project, so if there's something you don't like, you are very welcome tofile an issue or even fix things yourself and create a pull request. Please don't try to communicate with me via reviews, that doesn't work in both directions. You can always write me an email and I'll see what I can do."

# How do I enable it ?
Indic keyboard has a wizard that will walk you through the process of setting it up so that you can use it comfortably.

# When I try to enable the keyboard, I am getting a warning about ""collecting data""?
This message is a part of the Android operating system. It will appears whenever you try to enable a third party keyboard. Nothing to worry here.

# What is a keyboard layout ?
Indic keyboard provides multiple ""keyboard layouts"". This means that you will have different  ways to type in your native language.

Transliteration allows you to type out words using English characters, but will automatically transform the words to your native language. For example, if you type ""namaste"" in English while using Devanagari transliteration keyboard, it will transform it to नमस्ते correctly

Inscript layout is the standardized keyboard that Government of India came up with to cater for the majority of the languages in India. We support the full specification, and if you are already familiar with Inscript on your Desktop, it will work on the phone too.

Phonetic keyboard is similar to Transliteration scheme - you can type what the words sound like using English characters, and it will be automatically transformed into your language.

Compact Keyboard allows typing Indian languages without the shift key. You can long press on the letters to get more options.

FAQ:
Q: Why can't I update this app (""Signature incorrect"" error)?
A: Remove the application and install it again. Sorry about that but it's the only way. And not my fault. Someone included this app in a custom android build on your device or you installed it from a third-party-source and it isn't signed with my key, so there is no way you can update it.

Q: When I switch to offline-mode, how do I know when the caching is done?
A: There is no caching. The only difference to normal mode is that no connectivity is necessary and changes are stored locally. When switching to online again the spinning indicator should show while changes are uploaded. Caching occurs only when starting the app (everything except images) or the ImageCache is started (everything).

Q: Why don't articles appear as ""read"" when I did read them on my PC?
A: Most of the time this is no problem at all. But. There is simply no way to get this information from the Server-API. I have to guess how many articles could have been read since the last update of the local data and would probably transmit much more data then necessary in the end. So it *can* happen. But mostly it doesn't.

Q: Quote from the comments: ""SSL doesn't work anymore -> deinstall""
A: Yeah, deinstall. Don't want people like you around. Thanks. My fault. I broke some functionality by trying to make the app more secure and I didn't have the resources to make sure this didn't happen. Mostly because THIS THING IS FREE. I fixed it btw, but people like you don't care. So yeah, deinstall please.

The app relays real-time safety alerts published by the Home Front Command (Pikud Haoref).

★ Speed & reliability - alerts are received before / during the official siren thanks to dedicated notification servers
★ Location-based alerts - receive emergency alerts on the move in addition to city / region selection
★ Threat types - receive alerts about rocket fire, hostile aircraft intrusion, terrorist infiltration, and more
★ Alert history - see the list of recent alerts, their location, and time of day (in your local time)
★ Connectivity test - check, at any time, whether your device is able to receive alerts via the ""self-test"" option
★ Sound selection - choose from 15 unique sounds for alerts or choose a custom sound
★ Silent mode override - the application will override silent / vibrate mode to sound alerts
★ Vibration - your phone will vibrate in addition to playing the selected alert sound
★ Area selection - select preferred alert cities / regions by searching for them
★ Countdown - alerts will display the estimated time until impact
★ I'm safe - let your friends and family know you are safe by sending an ""I'm safe"" message via the app
★ Localization - the app has been translated to multiple languages (Hebrew, English, Arabic, Russian, Italian, Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese)

Attention:
1. This application was developed by volunteers and is not owned or operated by the military, country or Home Front Command.
2. The application is not a replacement for the official rocket alert systems, use it only as a supplement. In case of unstable connectivity, the application will not be able to receive rocket alerts.
3. Please adhere to the Home Front Command's official instructions for when a rocket alarm goes off:
http://www.oref.org.il/
4. Location-based Alerts require enabling a foreground service which updates your location in the background, even when you don't use the app.
5. There is an optional remote messaging foreground service which improves alert delivery in real time when the app is in the background.

The app is open sourced on GitHub:

It supports predictive text typing in 40+ languages, configurable hotkeys, text editing with undo/redo, and an on-screen keypad that can turn your smartphone into a Nokia from the 2000s. And, best of all, it doesn't spy on you!

This is a modernized version of the Traditional T9 Keypad IME by Lee Massi (Clam-), with many new features and languages.

Supported languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Simplified Chinese (Pinyin), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati (phonetic), Hebrew, Hindi (phonetic), Hinglish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese (Romaji), Kiswahili, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Serbian (Cyrillic) Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Moroccan Tamazight (Latin and Tifinagh), Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Yiddish.

Philosophy:
- No ads, no premium or paid features. It's all free.
- No spying, no tracking, no telemetry or reports. No nothing!
- No unnecessary bells or whistles. It only does its job, typing.
- The Full version operates entirely offline with no Internet permission. The Lite version connects only when downloading dictionaries from GitHub and when the voice input is active.
- Open-source, so you can verify all the above yourself.
- Created with help from the entire community.
- Things it will (probably) never have: QWERTY layout, swipe-typing, GIFs and stickers, backgrounds or other customizations. ""It can be any color you like, as long as it is black.""
- Not intended as a clone of Sony Ericsson, Nokia C2, Samsung, Touchpal, etc. It is understandable to miss your favorite old phone or keyboard app, but TT9 has its own unique design, inspired by the Nokia 3310 and 6303i. While it captures the feel of the classics, it offers its own experience and won’t replicate any device exactly.

Thank you for understanding, and enjoy TT9!

Features:

 ✔️ View metadata
 ✔️ Image preview
 ✔️ Remove metadata
 ✔️ Simple and intuitive interface
 ✔️ Share directly from the app

Learn more:

Whenever you take a picture, additional metadata is saved in the image file.
Most smartphones do not inform you about this.

Metadata can look like this:
 🕑 On which day was the picture taken, and at which time?
 🗺️ And where exactly?
 📷 Which camera or which smartphone was used?
 🔧 And which camera settings were used?
 📝 Notes of the photographer or the camera?
 📌 More and more often, even exact GPS coordinates are saved in your photo.

Metadata is sometimes very useful—for instance when sorting holiday photos.
But as soon as you share photos with others via social media, all this information is visible publicly.
Data collectors and stalkers would possibly be able to discover your place of residence or workplace from the metadata or draw conclusions about your daily routine.
Tracking services could create more comprehensive advertising profiles and sell your data to other organizations.

With our app, you can easily view all that data, remove it entirely, and then share the anonymized photo directly!
That way you stay anonymous and safe in internet, while your friends can still admire your cute cat.

Happy sharing! 😽"

""Oppia has helped me see things I learn in real life with examples. I liked everything about Oppia. I also like the stories."" - Jehdel, student

""I have always been shy at classes and I never answer my teacher because I do not like to make mistakes. Through Oppia, I feel more confident, because if I made mistakes, I have the chance to re-solve the question again, and to get the issue explained in multiple ways."" - Seneen, student

""Bringing [Oppia] to the school is what will motivate the students.

From what I saw by myself with Oppia, I can confirm this is so."" - Mrs. Ndubisi, Mathematics teacher

“It feels good to find such content on the internet. I was worried about my children's education through this pandemic, these lessons are keeping my kids' minds sharp and active."" - Jamal, parent
